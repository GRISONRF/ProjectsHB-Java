## Collection of projects made during the Hackbright Academy & Walmart X3 February 2023 cohort.

### Unit 1:  Mars Adventure Game. 
The Mars Adventure Game is a text-based game that allows the user to navigate a virtual mission to Mars using Java programming language. <br>

The game:
- Involves creating different Java classes such as Mars, GuessingGame, MarsExpedition, and FindingsList, which work together to create a dynamic and interactive experience. 
- Begins with the user landing on Mars and then follows a series of challenges, which require the user to make various decisions, solve puzzles, and collect findings. 
- Utilizes concepts such as if-else statements, for loops, ArrayLists, and HashMaps to create a realistic and immersive experience for the user


### Unit 2: Ordering System for Cupcakes and Drinks.
Simple ordering system for cupcakes and drinks. <br>

- The main method in Main.java creates a menu of cupcakes and drinks by instantiating objects of different classes and adding them to ArrayLists. 
- Then it creates an order using the Order constructor, which takes the menu items as parameters. The user is prompted to select items from the menu, which are added to an ArrayList and used to calculate the subtotal.
- The order is then saved to a file using the CreateFile and WriteToFile classes.
- Each class has its own functionality, with Cupcake, RedVelvet, Chocolate, Drink, Soda, and Milk classes extending the main Cupcake and Drink classes and adding their own unique features. The program also prints out the menu options and order summary to the console.


### Unit 3: Movie Voting
This project is about building a Java application using Spring Framework and Hibernate to create and manage a movie database. 

- The app provides interfaces to view movie details such as title, maturity rating, and genre.
- It can also list the best movie and provide a page to vote for the best movie. 
- The app uses a MySQL database to store movie details, and users can add new movies to the database. 
- Uses Spring MVC to handle HTTP requests and responses, and Thymeleaf as the view technology. Hibernate is used as an ORM tool to map the Java entities to database tables.
